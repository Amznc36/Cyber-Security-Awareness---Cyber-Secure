                <h3>Malware</h3>
                <p>Malware refers to any malicious software that performs unwanted actions on a device. There are various forms of Malware such as Adware, Worms, Trojans, Botnets, Ransomware, spyware, and Rootkits.</p>
                 <h3>Adware</h3>
                 <p>Adware also known as advertisement-supported software is utilized by developers/attackers to generate revenue via generating adverts on your screen typically within web Browsers but there are cases where it can spread to your Desktop as well. Attackers can use adware to generate revenue, but it can also create an open door for other malicious software to enter. Adware installs itself silently onto a device and intends for the user to click on the advertisement that it displays. Aim is to generate revenue.   There are three ways adware developers generate revenue. This is through third parties these are PPC(Pay-per-click), PPV(Pay-per-View), PPI(Pay-per-install).  It is also possible for Adware to analyse a devices browsing history and display customized advertisements that are relevant to the user.  Developers of Adware can make additional revenue by selling the location and browsing History to third parties.</p>
                 <h3>Worms</h3>
                 <p>Worms/Network Worms, are a type of malware that was designed to self-replicate and infect other computers while remaining active on an infected system with little or no user intervention using widely used network services such as browsing, email, and chat. In the past, worms relied on social engineering to spread in present day network worms know no boundaries the most advanced worms exploit software vulnerabilities in order infect other systems everyone connected to the internet is a potential victim. Worms can modify and delete files, in some cases, the purpose of a worm is to further replicate itself to deplete hard drive space or bandwidth by overloading shared networks</p>
                 <h3>Trojans</h3>
                 <p>Trojan is a form of malware in disguise as the name suggests they are designed to look harmless, but that isn’t it true nature, Trojans are made to look like legitimate programs in order to get the user to run them, their main objective is the destruction of files or even the operating system hence the only way to recover from a trojan is through restoration from a backup.</p>
                 <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                 <p>Ransomware which is a form a malware that is used to digitally extort victims into payment by restricting access to a system or even data, Encryption of Data, Trojan threat of destruction, and user lockout are all possible forms of ransomware. Ransomware attackers demand a payment in return for releasing your data, the attacker may also threaten to leak you’re your data to the public or even sell it on the dark web if the payment is not made in most cases they will demand for cryptocurrency as the blockchain is mostly untraceable. Ransomware infects devices through email attachments, Downloads, and compromised websites. Ransomware attacks in the past have had a severe impact on large enterprises such as the NHS, CAPCOM, and Royal Mail </p>
                 <h3>Spyware</h3>
                 <p>Spyware which is a form  of malicious software that is designed to enter the user’s device and gather data. Spyware used for commercial use, but either way it can leave the user vulnerable to breaches and misuse of information. Spyware installs itself on onto the user’s device without them noticing. It could be an accompanying package the user is installing on a malicious website, or even in a file attachment. if attackers choose to spyware can also be delivered to a device physically (USB, Phone), once the spyware has infiltrated the system it then monitors and captures data such as (keystrokes, screen captures, and tracking codes), once the data is captured it is sent to the attacker and the user is at their disposal. The Data that is often compromised through spyware is Logins, Credit Card credentials, Keyboard logs, browsing history, email address. Adware, Trojans, and key loggers are all examples of spyware.</p>
                 <h3>Botnets</h3>
                 <p>The next threat is Botnets.  Elsian,C.C (2012), states Botnets are one of the most significant threats to the world of cybersecurity when they are used to carry out malicious activity , a botnet is a network of computers that have been compromised and can be interacted with remotely in order to complete an attackers initiative he adds.  The communication between multiple compromised machines is one of the deadliest characteristics that set botnets apart from other malware, the compromised machines are known as the attacker bots, the attacker bots carry out function collectively as instructed by the attacker. The attacker that is in control of a botnets is known as the botmaster. The botmaster gives commands to connected bots through the Command-and-Control Chanel (C&C) without this channel the bots would be an uncoordinated group of independent compromised devices.</p>
                 <h3>Rootkits</h3>
                 <p>The term rootkit is a compound word formed from the two words Root is a reference to the most privileged user on a computer aka the Administrator whereas a kit Is a set of tools. A Rootkit is a set of tools/techniques implemented into malware to gain administrator access on a computer system once the Rootkit has access to the system it hides its presence from the User and Operating System. Malware such as Trojans and worms are associated with Rootkits The first malicious rootkit for windows was create by Greg Hoglund and known as the NTRootkit. The first rootkit targeting Mac OS X appeared in 2009. There are two variations of Rootkits, User-Mode Rootkits and Kernel-Mode rootkits.</p>
